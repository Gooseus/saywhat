# SayWhat
## A Web App That Reads a QueryString Parameter Aloud

It uses the now-seemingly-defunct [speak.js](https://github.com/kripken/speak.js), which I have forked with a vague intention of maintaining for general consumption.

Anyways, nothing to it, if you look at the speak.js helloworld example, this basically copies that and grabs the string from the querystring.

I designed it to do this quickly and hope to make it super duper fast at reading string passed in with support of all the features of the NEW and IMPROVED (maybe) speak.js

Let me know what you think and any problems you encounter.
